    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 4, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      UTDallas Eats (“we”, “us”, or “our”) operates the UTDallas Eats mobile application and related
      services (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your
      information when you use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using UTDallas Eats, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with
      this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.2 Payment and payout information (processed by Stripe)</h3>
    <p>
      We use Stripe to process payments from buyers and payouts to sellers. When you enter payment card
      information or connect a bank account, that information is collected, encrypted, and processed
      directly by Stripe. We do <strong>not</strong> store your full card number or bank account credentials
      on our servers.

      <li>Bank account details for payouts (via Stripe Financial Connections or other methods).</li>
      <li>Transaction details, including amounts, timestamps, and identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="section-muted">
      Stripe acts as our payment processor and payout provider. Their use of your data is governed
      by the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

      <li>Log data (IP address, access times, crash logs, and basic diagnostics).</li>
      <li>Usage data (screens viewed, buttons tapped, and other interactions) to help us understand and improve how the app is used.</li>
