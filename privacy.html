    <h1>UTDallas Eats Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 4, 2026</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how UTDallas Eats (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
      and protects your information when you use the UTDallas Eats mobile application
      and related services (collectively, the “Service”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
    <p>When you use UTDallas Eats, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information</strong>: your name, UTDallas email address, and role (buyer or seller).</li>
      <li><strong>Profile information</strong>: optional details you choose to add to your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Order information</strong>: details about orders you place or fulfill, including pricing and status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Payment and payout information (via Stripe)</h3>
    <p>
      We use Stripe to process payments from buyers and payouts to sellers.
      When you enter payment card details or connect a bank account, that information is
      collected and processed directly by Stripe. We <strong>do not</strong> store your full card number
      or bank account credentials on our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripe may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment card details and billing information.</li>
      <li>Bank account details for payouts (via Stripe Financial Connections or other methods).</li>
      <li>Transaction details (amounts, timestamps, identifiers).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="section-muted">
      Stripe acts as our payment processor and payout provider. Their use of your data is governed
      by the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

      <li>Log data (IP address, timestamps, error logs).</li>
      <li>Usage data (screens viewed, basic interaction events) for debugging and improving the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>We may share your information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers</strong> such as Stripe (payments, payouts, and tax calculations)
        and Supabase (authentication, database, and backend services), solely to operate the Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UTDallas Eats team members</strong> who need access to maintain and support the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal or safety reasons</strong> if required to comply with applicable law, regulation,
        legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We store data using trusted cloud providers. We take reasonable technical and organizational
      measures to protect your information, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
    </p>
    <p class="section-muted">
      Sensitive payment and bank information is handled by Stripe. We rely on Stripe’s security
      controls and do not store your full payment card or bank account credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with our

    </p>

      <li>You may update or correct your profile information in the app.</li>
      <li>You may disconnect your bank account or stop using the Service at any time.</li>
